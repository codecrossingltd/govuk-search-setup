# govuk-search-setup
A repository with setup scripts for getting search-related parts of GOV.UK running locally

## Motivation
There isn't currently a documented way to get a minimal set of search applications up and running,
without having to follow several bits of documentation and downloading production data. This is a
lightweight set of scripts to do this setup, so I can reliabily and repeatably create and tear down
local dev environments.
